# Gestura

Gestura is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) learning and text-input application built using computer vision and machine learning. It uses a standard webcam to recognize ASL hand gestures and provides interactive learning and free-writing modes.

## Features

### Education Mode
- Prompts the user with a target ASL letter
- Requires the sign to be held for a short duration to confirm
- Provides immediate feedback (Correct / Incorrect)
- Tracks score to support practice-based learning

### Free Write Mode
- Allows users to input letters using ASL hand gestures
- Letters are accepted only after being held consistently for ~2 seconds
- Buffered letters are displayed live
- Press **Space** to commit buffered letters into text
- Press **Delete (⌫)** to remove the last buffered letter
- Designed to reduce false positives and jitter

## How It Works

- MediaPipe Hands extracts 21 hand landmarks from the webcam feed
- Landmarks are normalized relative to the wrist
- A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained on custom-labeled ASL gesture data
- Predictions are made in real time and stabilized using frame-based confirmation

## Requirements

- Python 3.10, (later versions dont work properly with media pipe)
- Webcam





## Guide: Training and Using Gestura

### Step 1: Collect Training Data
Run the data collection script to record ASL hand gestures.

- Open the data collection mode (`train.py`)
- Select the letter you want to train
- Hold the corresponding ASL hand gesture steadily in view of the camera
- Captured landmark data will be saved to `asl_letters.csv`

Repeat this process for each letter you want the model to recognize.

---

### Step 2: Train the Model
Once data collection is complete:

- Run `train_model.py`
- This script trains a machine learning classifier on your collected data
- A trained model file (`model.pkl`) will be generated

This model is specific to the data you collected.

---

### Step 3: Run the Application
After training:

- Open the main application (`main.py`)
- Gestura will load the trained model automatically
- The application will now recognize ASL letters based on your custom training data

---

### Notes
- Model accuracy depends heavily on the quality and consistency of the training data
- A demo CSV file with pre-collected data is currently included, may not work well with your hand. (Just train model and its ready for use)
